# NLP-strategy-comprehension
This repository contains Python codes used to extract info from large amount of texts
## Overview

This project aims to analyze and process text data using various Python libraries and methodologies. The primary focus is on extracting and analyzing key terms within specified categories, utilizing techniques such as unigram and bigram frequency analysis. 

### Features

- **Text Data Processing**: Utilizes the `pandas` library for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Natural Language Processing**: Employs `nltk` and 'spacy' for text processing and tokenization.
- **Pattern Matching**: Implements regular expressions using the `re` library to extract specific patterns from the text.
- **Data Structures**: Utilizes the `collections` library to efficiently count and manage occurrences of terms.
- **JSON Handling**: Incorporates the `json` library for reading and writing data in JSON format.
- **Summarization**: Uses the `sumy` library for summarizing text data, enhancing the insights derived from the analysis.

### Analysis Methods

The analysis is structured around four main categories:
- **Sociale**: Focuses on social aspects within the text data.
- **culture**: Analyzes cultural references and themes.
- **Method**: Examines the methods employed in the data.
- **Digital**: Investigates digital elements and trends.

### Visual Representations

To provide a clearer understanding of the text data, the project includes visual representations, such as word clouds, which highlight the most frequently occurring terms and phrases.
